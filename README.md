BootstrapCK Skin
====================

The BootstrapCK-Skin is a skin for [CKEditor4](http://ckeditor.com/) based on [Twitter Bootstrap3](http://getbootstrap.com/) styles.

[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is used to rewrite the editor's styles and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to be able to watch, convert and minify the sass into css files.
These files aren't really needed for the simple use of the skin, but handy if you want to make some adjustments to it.

For more information about skins, please check the [CKEditor Skin SDK](http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_4.x/Skin_SDK)
documentation.

## Installation

#### Just skin please

Add the whole bootstrapck folder to the skin folder.
In ckeditor.js and config.js change the skin name to "bootstrapck".
Done!

#### The whole skin - sass - grunt package

All the sass files are included in the bootstrapck folder.
So follow the 'just skin please'-steps and add the Gruntfile.js to de ckeditor folder.
You can start tampering now.
